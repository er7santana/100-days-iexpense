# iExpense

In this project we’re going to build iExpense, which is an expense tracker that separates personal costs from business costs. At its core this is an app with a form (how much did you spend?) and a list (here are the amounts you spent), but in order to accomplish those two things you’re going to need to learn how to:

- Present and dismiss a second screen of data.
- Delete rows from a list
- Save and load user data
- …and more.

## Features

Today you have seven topics to work through, in which you’ll learn about @Observable, sheet(), onDelete(), and more.

- Using @State with classes
- Sharing SwiftUI state with @Observable
- Showing and hiding views
- Deleting items using onDelete()
- Storing user settings with UserDefaults
- Archiving Swift objects with Codable
